# Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts

This project is a simple static website built with HTML and CSS, created using the guide provided by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/journeys/full-stack-engineer/paths/fscj-22-web-development-foundations/tracks/fscj-22-html-and-css/modules/wdcp-22-css-box-model/project/off-platform-project-dasmotos).  
It serves as an example of how to structure and style a basic multi-section page for a fictional arts and crafts store called **Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts**.

## Features
- **Hero Header**: Large, eye-catching store title styled with a background image.
- **Color-Coded Sections**: Each product category (Brushes, Frames, Paint) is styled with a unique background color.
- **Styled Text**: Section headings and prices use custom fonts, weights, and colors.
- **Inline Product Display**: Each product is represented with an image, description, and price.
- **Simple Responsive Base**: Basic layout renders cleanly on different screen sizes.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the structure and content of the arts & crafts page.
- `styles.css`: Defines styling rules for layout, typography, and section formatting.
- `hacksaw.jpeg`, `frames.jpeg`, `finnish.jpeg`, `pattern.jpeg`: Images used in the webpage.

## Usage

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.

## Customization
If youâ€™d like to modify this page:
